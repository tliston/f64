A 64-Bit version of the Forth programming language.

Why? Because the idea of a Threaded Interpretive Language fascinated me.

The book [Threaded Interpretive Languages: Their Design and Implementation](https://www.amazon.com/Threaded-Interpretive-Languages-Design-Implementation/dp/007038360X) is fantastic, and you SHOULD read it. Additionally, Dave Gauer's Forth Pages, especially [Forth: The Programming Language That Writes Itself](https://ratfactor.com/forth/the_programming_language_that_writes_itself.html), are also excellent.
