\ Count to 1,000,000,000
\ This is ~14x slower than a similarly hand-coded assembly language version.
\ This is caused by having to deal with the stack-based nature of Forth. We have to
\ duplicate our value in order to do the comparison, so there's pops and pushes
\ happening in Forth, where there isn't in straight-up assembler. There is also a lot
\ of overhead due to the threaded interpretive nature of Forth, jumping around through
\ the defined words. I'm actually pleasantly surprised that it's only 14 times slower.
